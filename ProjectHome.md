Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (both norm-conserving and ultrasoft).

This is a customized version of the code, it contains changes mainly in postprocessing,
SCF convergence, pseudopotential generation.
